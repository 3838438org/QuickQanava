# GTpo

GTpo (Generic Topology) is the C++11 graph topology library used in QuickQanava2 graph visualization library. GTpo is available under the 
MIT licence.

GTpo is not a generic library in the Boot Graph Library sense, but rather an highly configurable graph modelling library designed for
ease of use an maximum performances over "genericity". GTpo heavily rely on C++11/C++17 functionnalities to hide template complexity from the user. GTpo
root namespace 'gtpo' contains generic code, user not interested in using specific containers could use one of the following namespaces for accessing a 
"concrete GTpo library" directly:
\li 'stpo': Direct use of GTpo with C++ standard library.
\li 'qtpo': Direct use of GTpo for Qt/QML.

GTpo is highly alpha.
